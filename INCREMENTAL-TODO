* dump core with the dependency info and make it possible to continue from there
* it should be necessary to compile&load only those files that changed.
* dependency tracking refactoring:
** if component A provides X which is already provided somewhere else,
   things using X need to depend on A
** need a way to re-provide something: have an explicit component order. This
   happened implicitly before, but we now need to track the /reason/
   why things depend on each other.
