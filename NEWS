* Changes in 1.0.0 relative to 0.6.3:
** Lots of changes sponsored by ITA Software:
*** Standard compliance: Better parsing of declare/docstring combinations.
*** Better recognition of just about everything.
*** Incremental dependency groveling.
** Tentative openmcl support.
** Put the macroexpansion handler definitions into handlers/00-standard-handlers.lisp
   for easier extension by user packages.
** Exported signal-user and signal-provider functions to ease recognition of
   complex dependencies in user code.
** Put asdf-dependency-grovel:groveling on *features* if the groveler
   is active.

* Changes in 0.6.3 relative to 0.6.2:
** Fixed a silly bug in the last refactoring that caused duplicate names.

* Changes in 0.6.2 relative to 0.6.1:
** Added Class instrumented-module:
*** This class has a :default-component-type of
    instrumented-cl-source-file, and initargs :additional-dependencies
    and :override-dependencies, which control the dependencies of the
    components the module contains.
** Added initargs to instrumented-cl-source-file:
*** :translated-name replaces the :component-translations initarg of
    the component-file component.
*** :translated-pathname-form replaces the pathname part of the
    :component-translations in component-file.
*** :additional-dependencies and :override-dependencies as in
    instrumented-module.
** It is no longer possible to pass alist translations to the
   component-file component; instead, use instrumented-cl-source-file
   and instrumented-module components in the instrumented systems and
   pass the translations directly.

* Changes in 0.6.1 relative to 0.6.0:
** Added :output-file-type to the initargs of
   instrumented-cl-source-file. The value of this argument will be
   emitted as the output component's component type.

* 0.6.0: initial release.
